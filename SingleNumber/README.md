### Single Number
<p>Instructions: Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space. </p>

### Approach
<p> Simple small algorithm</p>

* Sort the array then check each element to see if either of its neighbours are equal
	* If they are not the same return that number


### Concepts Used 
* Bit Manipulation
* Array
